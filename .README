#Text Conferincing 

## Usage
'textConf' to start client in client folder 
'TCserver 5000' to start server in server folder 


## Compilation 
make in either folder builds their corresponding files and creates the executables you run in usage  

## Notes for now 
server.c and client.c contain their coresponding setups
the command files in each document handle the actual commands we need to execute
helper files do everthing in between 

## TODO

have to create session struct to hold information about whos in the session, who made the session etc
this has to be done dynamically. need to keep a live list that updates when people join and leave 

After the session struct and functions are setup, implementing the other functions should be pretty chill

error checking literally everything -> if you ever get stuck on something just start doing this

making sure the acks that are sent follow the description in the lab doc
