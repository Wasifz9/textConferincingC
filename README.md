# Text Conf

## status
one user can now create sessions and leave session. both functions work correctly and just need to be error handled more 


## to do 
This has to be done now cause other functions rely on multiple clients 

multi threading the server to accept new clients while serveing requests for old clients 
a) im thinking use pthread to assign new threads to a client whenever they join
